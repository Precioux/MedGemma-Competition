Okay. Yes. Good, thank you. El Segundo, right down the street. The beach. What are some things you don't really like about yourself? I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Nice! What's one of your most memorable experiences? I'm not sure. Probably graduating from college, maybe. Can you tell me about that? I was the first person in my family to graduate, I guess, from college. So it's kind of a big deal. That's great. What did you study at school? Advertising, communications, and public relations. How did you decide to do that? Well, I've... In junior college I did communications, a lot of public speaking classes, so I went on and transferred to a university and wanted to study the same thing, I guess. Are you still working in that? Yeah, I work in advertising now. What's your dream job? Dream job? Probably to work for a big golf company and do their advertising for them. Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or? I'm definitely not shy. Maybe might seem like it right now just because I'm not. This is a different and new setting, but usually outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I like to go to the gym. I think I like to run and be outdoors. I surf a lot, so anytime I'm stressed, I definitely just try to go to the gym or play. wake up earlier and surf before work. I don't really have a temper. I just, I'm pretty mellow. When was the last time you argued with someone? I haven't really argued with anyone. We have disagreements, you know, with family members or friends, but it's usually solved right then and there. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I'm not sure. What's something you feel guilty about? Maybe not providing for my family as much as I'd like to, I guess. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your life. I'm not sure. Off the top of my head. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's pretty good. We're all pretty close. Dad, mom, sisters, brothers, wife, in-laws, siblings, everyone, pets. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Probably my dad. He's a hard worker, and he's kind of trained me to do the same thing, be the same way. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? that's one thing i struggle with i definitely get a good night's sleep but it's hard to go to sleep just over the years of um sleep deprived in some a little bit of insomnia i mean it's getting better now that i'm getting older i'm trained train my body to go to bed around one but when i was younger it was two three four in the morning i feel okay happy i mean a little bit right now just because uh My wife is pregnant, so I'm slowly feeling a little bit of the side effects, I guess. Can you tell me about them? Yeah, like, I mean, I feel a little down here and there, but at the same time, like I said, I just go to the gym or go for a longer run, you know, because she's healthy, we're healthy, you know, everything's good and all that. But supposedly, you get the man pregnancy side effects. It's our first, so I'm unfamiliar with the feelings. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. This morning, when I woke up. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have not. Tell me about something you did recently that you... I got to get together with a couple of my friends and play a round of golf, enjoy the sunshine, nice day. How would your best friend describe you? As outgoing and hardworking and a good family person. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Maybe just to... have a little bit more confidence. I don't recall. Not really, I try not to have any regrets. Just move forward from something negative, I guess. Just try to move on. To go to school, stay in school, invest early, start a 401k early, all the things. Start a retirement fund. I'll leave off. Just being raised by a good family and training myself to be a hard worker and hard enough worker to provide for my family and hopefully be successful one day and CEO of my company. Right now I'm at the bottom of my advertising agency, but continue to work harder and move up. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.
