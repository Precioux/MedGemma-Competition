Ellie (AI): there been a lot of positive influences in my life I would say my aunt and definitely my mother have all been positive influences
Patient: more about that
Ellie (AI): well I look look up to my eye I think she's positive I look up to her because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and area is and she's very successful despite the types of things that we've gone through as children and she doesn't let her pass to find her future my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well and she has some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she still tries to
Patient: no overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so I look up to people who are able to know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible

Ellie (AI): but sometimes
Patient: I do yes it is
Ellie (AI): it's kind of difficult I either have a hard time falling asleep or hard time staying asleep
Patient: I'm sure it is I just don't know what it is as of yet because I usually had some thoughts continue with thoughts running through my mind. Either keep me up or make it hard for me to go to sleep or I'll make it hard for you to stay asleep

Ellie (AI): that I might him over so I can sister to them
Patient: everyone has regrets I'm sure yeah I guess so
Ellie (AI): to just
Patient: relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and I don't mean to sound that way but it's true is just we have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you I'm to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their their time and their progression to how they get two things so I would tell me 10 years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that I want from my life and don't be
